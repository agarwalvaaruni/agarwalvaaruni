### Hi there 👋


**agarwalvaaruni/agarwalvaaruni**.

I am Vaaruni Agarwal. My main areas of interest are Data Science and Data Visualisation. Currently I am working on Tableau for Data Visualisation. Python is what I like to use for Data Science. My recent project is the Covid-19 Analysis using Python with Jupyter Notebooks. I am also planning to start an Instagram Page really soon! Always up for new challenges and projects. Cheers ✨
